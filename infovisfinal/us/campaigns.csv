4/27/16,ArchHacks - Next WashU Hackathon!,404,"Hi {First}! We just launched our application for ArchHacks - the next hackathon at WashU. Check out the new website and apply at archhacks.io! We thought you might be particularly interested since you registered for the hackathon we had last year - WUHack. Our hackathon is quadrupling in size, which means we will have tons of mentors and cool prizes for working on projects that matter. Happy to answer any questions you or anyone else from {School} might have at info@archhacks.io. Thanks! Allen"
4/29/16,ArchHacks Application is Live!,106,"Hi {First Name}, Thanks for signing on to get more info about ArchHacks! We just launched our new site with the application for the event at ArchHacks.io. Just so you know, the first 200 applications are put in a raffle for a fun ArchHacks-themed prize, and we're currently at 150. Hope to see your application soon! Best, Allen"
8/8/16,ArchHacks - Thanks for applying!,843,"Hey {First}, Thanks for applying to ArchHacks! I just wanted to give you a heads up that with 850+ applications and just 3 months until the event (get hyped) I'm going to be working with the team to start reviewing and accepting the first 400 hackers. Expect another email from me next Monday or Tuesday (8/15, 8/16). And don't sweat, if you don't get accepted immediately, we'll keep rolling over into the next round of apps. We just can't review all of the apps in one week... that'd be insane... Shameless plug, our awesome web dev Jake put together this portal where you can see how many apps your school has, and how close you are to getting a guaranteed bus. Is this something you think is useful? Is there anything we can do to make it better? I'm also excited to share the first interview from our ""Why HealthTech"" series. So we interviewed a bunch of cool companies around what health tech means to them and why they see it as important, and we're pulling those interviews into short clips. Check out the first one on our Facebook page! And last thing, I'll follow up about travel reimbursements in my email next week too. We're still figuring some of that stuff out. :) Thanks, Allen"

8/17/16,ArchHacks Application - Rolled Over to Next Round,694,"Hi {First name}! Thanks again for applying to ArchHacks - the whole team is putting a TON of time into planning it, so I'm super excited you're interested too. I just wanted to follow up on my email from last week about our first round of acceptances. We completed the first 400 this weekend, and we're just getting started. Like I mentioned, there's just not enough time in the day (or even the week) for us to go through all the apps at once, so we're staggering our acceptances based on how many apps we can review. I wanted to let you know that your app has been rolled-over (read not denied) to our next round of review. We're steadily working through the applications, and I appreciate your patience as we make our way down the list to yours. Hope to see you in November! Best, Allen"
9/18/16,ArchHacks Applications Closing,288,"Hey {First}, Sorry to bother you, but I just wanted to follow up about ArchHacks - the largest student hackathon ever hosted at Washington University in St. Louis - on November 4 - 6. Since we're less than 2 months away from the event, we're going to close applications October 15 to have time to get things ordered (like free t-shirts and food), so I wanted to give you a heads up to apply if you're interested. Speaking of food, we've partnered with Seoul Taco, Pi Pizza, and a few other local favorites to have free food for you the whole weekend. Hope to see you in November! Best, Allen"

9/29/16,ArchHacks - Grab a Friend!,415,"Hey {First Name}, I'm really excited to have you at ArchHacks - thanks for letting us know you're attending! I'm trying to get a handle on how many people are coming to order shirts and things, so the RSVP is super helpful. {Message}We're going to close the application in 2 weeks, so if any of your friends, classmates, or random acquaintances might want to apply, you should tell them to soon! We're even giving away a *private study room* for the weekend to the person (and their team) that refers the most people this month. You can see one in the hype video - whiteboard walls, tables, a TV, the whole thing! Just so you know, I'm going to be counting the number by email, so when they apply at archhacks.io, have them put down this email for you as their referrer (to make sure it counts). See you in the Slack! Allen"

We've been tabling around campus this week, and I could really use your help to get the word out. Whether you want to learn, build, or come and eat (with amazing company) ArchHacks should be a great time - and we want to make sure as many WashU students can participate as possible. I just wanted to let you know that tomorrow we'll be at Cheap Lunch in Lopata Gallery 11:30-1pm and at dinner in BD 6-8pm. Come stop by to learn more about WashU's annual hackathon, or just to say hi! (You can see the full week's events here.)

Since we're closing applications tonight, do you think any of your friends might be interested {Name}? I'm trying to get a final push to get you a bus to come :) I tried going through some on-campus administrators, but I don't think that went anywhere honestly. Did you ever see any of those emails?
