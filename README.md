#README - 

The README file must give an overview of what you are handing in: which parts are your code, which parts are libraries, and so on. The README must contain URLs to your project websites. The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface

Heatmap - 
JQuery was used to help add more responsiveness to the visualization such as helping to resize the view when the window size is changed.
The view can be seen at http://stephaniemertz.com/IV/heatmap.html or aaosgood3.github.io/heatmap/heatmap.html
Styling (legend, transition between datasets, etc) was heavily borrowed from Tom May's example. 

Features:
Tooltip - the styled tooltip shows precisely how many applications there are on average for each time to give a more granular view of 
the data encoded by the darkness of the tile.

Toggle data buttons - the buttons can toggle between different datasets to allow the user to get a deeper view into how summer vs semester
plays into the data.

The transition between the different datasets is animated so a user can keep their eyes on one day/time or area and watch how the color lightens/darkens
It is harder to compare when the screen goes white in between views.
